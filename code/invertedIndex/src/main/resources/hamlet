85
86
87	[FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO]
88
89	BERNARDO	Who's there?
90
91	FRANCISCO	Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
92
93	BERNARDO	Long live the king!
94
95	FRANCISCO	Bernardo?
96
97	BERNARDO	He.
98
99	FRANCISCO	You come most carefully upon your hour.
100
101	BERNARDO	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
102
103	FRANCISCO	For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
104	And I am sick at heart.
105
106	BERNARDO	Have you had quiet guard?
107
108	FRANCISCO	Not a mouse stirring.
109
110	BERNARDO	Well, good night.
111	If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
112	The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
113
114	FRANCISCO	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
115
116	[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
117
118	HORATIO	Friends to this ground.
119
120	MARCELLUS	And liegemen to the Dane.
121
122	FRANCISCO	Give you good night.
123
124	MARCELLUS	O, farewell, honest soldier:
125	Who hath relieved you?
126
127	FRANCISCO	Bernardo has my place.
128	Give you good night.
129
130	[Exit]
131
132	MARCELLUS	Holla! Bernardo!
133
134	BERNARDO	Say,
135	What, is Horatio there?
136
137	HORATIO	A piece of him.
138
139	BERNARDO	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
140
141	MARCELLUS	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
142
143	BERNARDO	I have seen nothing.
144
145	MARCELLUS	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
146	And will not let belief take hold of him
147	Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
148	Therefore I have entreated him along
149	With us to watch the minutes of this night;
150	That if again this apparition come,
151	He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
152
153	HORATIO	Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
154
155	BERNARDO	Sit down awhile;
156	And let us once again assail your ears,
157	That are so fortified against our story
158	What we have two nights seen.
159
160	HORATIO	Well, sit we down,
161	And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
162
163	BERNARDO	Last night of all,
164	When yond same star that's westward from the pole
165	Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
166	Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
167	The bell then beating one,--
168
169	[Enter Ghost]
170
171	MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
172
173	BERNARDO	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
174
175	MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
176
177	BERNARDO	Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
178
179	HORATIO	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
180
181	BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.
182
183	MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.
184
185	HORATIO	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
186	Together with that fair and warlike form
187	In which the majesty of buried Denmark
188	Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
189
190	MARCELLUS	It is offended.
191
192	BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!
193
194	HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
195
196	[Exit Ghost]
197
198	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
199
200	BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
201	Is not this something more than fantasy?
202	What think you on't?
203
204	HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe
205	Without the sensible and true avouch
206	Of mine own eyes.
207
208	MARCELLUS	                  Is it not like the king?
209
210	HORATIO	As thou art to thyself:
211	Such was the very armour he had on
212	When he the ambitious Norway combated;
213	So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
214	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
215	'Tis strange.
216
217	MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
218	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
219
220	HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;
221	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
222	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
223
224	MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
225	Why this same strict and most observant watch
226	So nightly toils the subject of the land,
227	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
228	And foreign mart for implements of war;
229	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
230	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
231	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
232	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
233	Who is't that can inform me?
234
235	HORATIO	That can I;
236	At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
237	Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
238	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
239	Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
240	Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
241	For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
242	Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
243	Well ratified by law and heraldry,
244	Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
245	Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
246	Against the which, a moiety competent
247	Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
248	To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
249	Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
250	And carriage of the article design'd,
251	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
252	Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
253	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
254	Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
255	For food and diet, to some enterprise
256	That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
257	As it doth well appear unto our state--
258	But to recover of us, by strong hand
259	And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
260	So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
261	Is the main motive of our preparations,
262	The source of this our watch and the chief head
263	Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
264
265	BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:
266	Well may it sort that this portentous figure
267	Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
268	That was and is the question of these wars.
269
270	HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
271	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
272	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
273	The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
274	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
275	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
276	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
277	Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
278	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
279	And even the like precurse of fierce events,
280	As harbingers preceding still the fates
281	And prologue to the omen coming on,
282	Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
283	Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
284	But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
285
286	[Re-enter Ghost]
287
288	I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
289	If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
290	Speak to me:
291	If there be any good thing to be done,
292	That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
293	Speak to me:
294
295	[Cock crows]
296
297	If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
298	Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
299	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
300	Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
301	For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
302	Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
303
304	MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
305
306	HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.
307
308	BERNARDO	'Tis here!
309
310	HORATIO	'Tis here!
311
312	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!
313
314	[Exit Ghost]
315
316	We do it wrong, being so majestical,
317	To offer it the show of violence;
318	For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
319	And our vain blows malicious mockery.
320
321	BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
322
323	HORATIO	And then it started like a guilty thing
324	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
325	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
326	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
327	Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
328	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
329	The extravagant and erring spirit hies
330	To his confine: and of the truth herein
331	This present object made probation.
332
333	MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
334	Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
335	Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
336	The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
337	And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
338	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
339	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
340	So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
341
342	HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
343	But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
344	Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
345	Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
346	Let us impart what we have seen to-night
347	Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
348	This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
349	Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
350	As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
351
352	MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
353	Where we shall find him most conveniently.
354
355	[Exeunt]
356

359
360	HAMLET
361
362
363	ACT I
364
365
366
367	SCENE II	A room of state in the castle.
368
369
370	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
371	POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
372	and Attendants]
373
374	KING CLAUDIUS	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
375	The memory be green, and that it us befitted
376	To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
377	To be contracted in one brow of woe,
378	Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
379	That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
380	Together with remembrance of ourselves.
381	Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
382	The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
383	Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
384	With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
385	With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
386	In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
387	Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
388	Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
389	With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
390	Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
391	Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
392	Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
393	Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
394	Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
395	He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
396	Importing the surrender of those lands
397	Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
398	To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
399	Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
400	Thus much the business is: we have here writ
401	To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
402	Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
403	Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
404	His further gait herein; in that the levies,
405	The lists and full proportions, are all made
406	Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
407	You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
408	For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
409	Giving to you no further personal power
410	To business with the king, more than the scope
411	Of these delated articles allow.
412	Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
413
414
415	CORNELIUS	|
416	|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
417	VOLTIMAND	|
418
419
420	KING CLAUDIUS	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
421
422	[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
423
424	And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
425	You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
426	You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
427	And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
428	That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
429	The head is not more native to the heart,
430	The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
431	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
432	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
433
434	LAERTES	My dread lord,
435	Your leave and favour to return to France;
436	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
437	To show my duty in your coronation,
438	Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
439	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
440	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
441
442	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
443
444	LORD POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
445	By laboursome petition, and at last
446	Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
447	I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
448
449	KING CLAUDIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
450	And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
451	But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
452
453	HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
454
455	KING CLAUDIUS	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
456
457	HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
458
459	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
460	And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
461	Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
462	Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
463	Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
464	Passing through nature to eternity.
465
466	HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.
467
468	QUEEN GERTRUDE	If it be,
469	Why seems it so particular with thee?
470
471	HAMLET	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
472	'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
473	Nor customary suits of solemn black,
474	Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
475	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
476	Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
477	Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
478	That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
479	For they are actions that a man might play:
480	But I have that within which passeth show;
481	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
482
483	KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
484	To give these mourning duties to your father:
485	But, you must know, your father lost a father;
486	That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
487	In filial obligation for some term
488	To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
489	In obstinate condolement is a course
490	Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
491	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
492	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
493	An understanding simple and unschool'd:
494	For what we know must be and is as common
495	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
496	Why should we in our peevish opposition
497	Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
498	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
499	To reason most absurd: whose common theme
500	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
